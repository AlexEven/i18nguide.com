Hi,

I'm Julien and I currently work at PrestaShop, an open-source ecommerce software.

I'm writing here everything you need to know about internalizing your software. This is purely on
from technical point of view, nothing about marketing or culture. I'm talking file format,
software to use, API, standards and such.

If you want to contribute, please feel free to [open any kind of pull-request on GitHub][repo].

Thanks for reading!
